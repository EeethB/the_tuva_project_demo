# Tuva Claims Demo

## üß∞ What does this project do?

The Tuva Claims Demo provides a quick and easy way to run the Tuva Project with synthetic demo data. 
You can run the project with built-in sample data loaded as seeds. 
(A future release will provide the option to download and install the full demo data from data shares.)

For a detailed overview of what the Tuva Project does and how it works, check out our [Knowledge Base](https://thetuvaproject.com/docs/getting-started). 
To setup the Tuva Project with your own claims demo, please review the ReadMe in [The Tuva Project](https://github.com/tuva-health/the_tuva_project) package for a detailed walkthrough and setup.
